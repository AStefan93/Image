# Image
Use CImg.h from http://cimg.eu/ in main project.

The Image project is a library for image processing. Trying to create something similar to OpenCV, the main purpose of the project is for me to learn digital signal processing techniques and not build an extensive and stable library.

Use it if you find it useful.
